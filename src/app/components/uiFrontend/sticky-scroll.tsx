        In March of 2022, I graduated from computer science school at the Galgotias University. There, I became obsessed with frontend code visualization. <br />
        <br />
        I was deeply fascinated in the concepts of modularity and adaptability â€” how written code renders on the screens gives me dopamine.

        Though I loved the freedom of academic practice, I was greatly dissatisfied with just how slow the industry actually moved. <br />
        <br />
        I wanted to push my design craft at a faster pace and have a positive impact on vastly more people.

        When the pandemic struck, I took it as an opportunity to explore new things. I came across creative competitions such as Augumented Reality Design and Development, and thought it might be fun to just give it a go. <br />
        <br />
        Long story short, my failures eventually turned into successes, and the rest was history.

        To my advantage, I was able leverage a lot of the technical skills and I had picked up during computer science school to greatly expedite my journey of self-learning UX Design. <br />
        <br />
        I loved solving problems by making stuff, and really valued visual storytelling and paying meticulous attention to precision and craftsmanship.

        I'm probably making tweaks to my portfolio or hanging out with my buddies in design or tech. <br />
        <br />
        Other than that, you'll find me hitting the gym, gaming, and trying to get my hands on the latest tech.
